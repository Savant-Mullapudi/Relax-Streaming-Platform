Relax is a modern video streaming UI built with React that clones the core features of YouTube. Users can search for videos, browse by categories, and watch content in a responsive and visually appealing layout. The app includes a sidebar for category navigation, a dynamic search bar, video cards with thumbnails and channel info, and a detailed video playback page with related videos and metadata.

It is developed using React, React Router, Material UI, and React Player, and fetches video data through the YouTube Data API from Rapid API. The interface is fully responsive, with optimized layouts for both desktop and mobile devices.
